Artificial Intelligence has transformed cybersecurity into an arms race. 
Traditional antivirus software, which relies on detecting known virus signatures, is no longer effective. 
Modern attackers use AI to adapt, evade detection, and launch more complex attacks. `AI_Cybersecurity_Essential ...`

1. One of the most well-known examples is the SolarWinds hack in 2020.
Attackers compromised the supply chain of SolarWinds’ Orion software, inserting malicious code into official updates. Using AI-enhanced tools, they filtered through massive amounts of stolen data, identified valuable government and corporate targets, and remained undetected for months. In total, around 18,000 organizations were affected, including critical U.S. government agencies. This incident showed how powerful AI-driven techniques can be in large-scale cyber espionage.

2. DeepLocker was introduced by IBM Security in 2018 as a proof-of-concept. It was not a real virus in the wild, but a demonstration of how artificial intelligence could be used to create highly targeted and stealthy malware
  DeepLocker uses neural networks, computer vision, and machine learning to remain hidden. It stays dormant inside a system until it identifies its exact target — for example, by facial recognition, voice recognition, geolocation, or even user behavior. Once the conditions are met, it “unlocks” and releases its malicious payload with surgical precision.

Why is it dangerous?
Precision: Attacks only the intended victim, such as a government official or military system.
Stealth: Looks harmless until activation, making it invisible to traditional antivirus.
Polymorphism: Can change its code and appearance to evade detection.
Multi-criteria targeting: Uses a mix of visual, audio, and behavioral data to ensure it only strikes the right person or system.

Potential Impacts
Infiltrating critical infrastructure (power grids, water systems, transport) and activating at the worst possible time.
Espionage and sabotage against specific targets.
Long-term hidden operations, collecting data for years without being noticed.
Psychological warfare, since the very idea of such malware creates fear and distrust.

DeepLocker shows how AI can make cyberattacks more personalized, precise, and nearly invisible. While it started as a research concept, it highlights the risks of future AI-powered threats.

The impact of these attacks is severe: financial losses, disruption of critical infrastructure, stolen data, and long-term damage to reputation `AI_Cybersecurity_Essential`

To defend against such threats, organizations are adopting AI-powered security tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR), 
which can detect unusual behavior in real time and stop attacks before they spread.
At the same time, staff training and international cooperation are essential, because 95% of breaches still involve human error. `AI_Cybersecurity_Essential`
