# Network and Application Attacks

## What is Cyber Attack?

A cyber attack is a set of actions performed by threat actors, who try to gain unauthorized access, steal data or cause damage to computers, computer networks, or other computing systems.

The individuals who launch cyber attacks are usually referred to as cybercriminals, threat actors, bad actors, or hackers. 

## Cyber attack statistics

The global cost of cyber attacks is expected to grow by 15% per year and is expected to reach over $10 trillion. A growing part of this cost is Ransomware attacks, which now cost businesses in the US $20 billion per year.

The average cost of a data breach in the US is $3.8 million. Another alarming statistic is that public companies lose an average of 8% of their stock value after a successful breach.

## Cyber Attack Example

# Amazon DDoS Attack

In February 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the target of a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The company experienced and mitigated a 2.3 Tbps (terabits per second) DDoS attack, which had a packet forwarding rate of 293.1 Mpps and a request rate per second (rps) of 694,201. It is considered one of the largest DDoS attacks in history.

# Twitter (or X) Celebrities Attack

In July 2020, Twitter was breached by a group of three attackers, who took over popular Twitter accounts. They used social engineering attacks to steal employee credentials and gain access to the companyâ€™s internal management systems, later identified by Twitter as vishing (phone phishing).

Dozens of well-known accounts were hacked, including Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk. The attackers used the stolen accounts to post bitcoin scams and earned more than $100,000. Two weeks after the events, the US Justice Department charged three suspects, one of whom was 17 years old at the time.
